Labyrinth is a fault tolerant job scheduler.  It is based
on a Python Flask API and is designed to run in a cluster
where one node is designated as a leader and the others as
workers.  If the leader goes down and does not communicate
to the workers within a specified period of time, the workers
will communicate with eachother and elect a new leader.  If
a worker goes down and does not communicate for a specified 
period of time the leader will reassign all jobs running on
the failed worker to the other available workers.
